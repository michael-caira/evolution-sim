# Evolution Sim

Following the [guide here](https://pwy.io/en/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/), a handwritten evolution simulation was built and developed to run in the browser.
The simulation models bird agents that evolve using a genetic algorithm fed by a FFNN to improve and crossover the behaviour of agents from generation of the population, to the next.
